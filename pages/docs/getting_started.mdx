Once you've completed that step, the deploy process will prompt you to provide the requested environment variables, which are described below.

</Steps>

## Customizing your DAO site

<Steps>
###  Connect Wallet
After deploying your new site, click on the dash located in the top right corner. This will prompt a dropdown menu to appear, which will allow you to connect your wallet.

### Theme Editor

After connecting your wallet, you will see a button labeled "Edit Theme."

![](public/edit_theme.png)

This modal enables you to update your DAO website by utilizing data from an [onchain registry](/docs/theming/onchain_theming). You can reference a theming configuration for any address or contract owned by another address.

![](public/modal.png)

#### Presets 
There are 5 themes available from the registry: `Default`, `Light`, `Midori`, `Nouns`, `Obscura`, and `Slime`.

#### Advanced 

For more advanced customizations, you can create new themes and update the DAO site without needing any coding skills. You have the option to change colors of the text and background, modify buttons, borders, and border size, select fonts, and overall form unique branding for your DAO site. After editing the theme, you can to revert it back to default, or save changes.

**Saving changes to your theme**

> To access this, admin privileges are required. In case you haven't assigned any admins for your site, you can follow the new `platformIndex` setup guide.
 
If you wish to save your design, you will be updating the theme in the themeRegistry. As an admin this happens through a signed transaction that builds a new reference for the metadata your site relies on.  Upon signing a brand new tokenURI is initialized as a `newTheme` with the signer serving as the `themeAdmin`. Admins can assign additional managers for the site who are also able to make updates to the site's overall layout.
