### Deploy to Vercel

> For this step you will need to sign into your github on vercel; If you don’t have a GitHub account, follow our [Getting Started with GitHub](https://www.loom.com/share/b39dcc47d5724dbb937270191fc016a9) and [Vercel Setup](https://www.loom.com/share/457c57d0fbdc4801a5f4cede65faf167) tutorial. 

Create your new repository and make sure to name it the same as your DAO website name.

Once you've completed that step, the deploy process will prompt you to provide the requested environment variables, which are described below.

<OptionTable options={[
       ['NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID', 'The name of your website'],
       ['NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_DESCRIPTION', 'The description of your site'],
       ['NEXT_PUBLIC_TWITTER_HANDLE', 'The twitter handle for your DAO'],
       ['NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_KEY','The API key from your Alchemy dashboard.'],
       ['NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID', 'Mainnet = 1,  Testnet = 5'],
       ['NEXT_PUBLIC_DAO_ADDRESS', 'The Address of your Nouns Build DAO'],
       ['NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_INDEX','The index value of your platform theme contract'],
       ['NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3STORAGE_TOKEN','API Key for Web 3 Storage'],
       ['NEXT_PUBLIC_REGISTRY_CONTRACT','Contract address for theme registry']
      ]}/>
