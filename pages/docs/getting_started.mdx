# Getting Started with Flexible
import { Callout, Tab, Tabs, Steps } from "nextra-theme-docs";

Here, we outline the process of forking the Flexible DAO Interfaces template and creating your own DAO site powered by an onchain theming contract.

## Quickstart 

<Steps>
### Start 

Click on the `+` in the top-right corner of the navigation bar. This will open a dropdown menu that gives you the option to "Connect your wallet" or "Copy our template".

### Create Platform Index

In the pop-up message you will be asked to follow the steps to create your own DAO interface.

The first step in this process is creating your platform index.

> What is this? There is a registry that underlies the deployment process, enabling DAO site owners to initialize site managers and implement custom theming via smart contracts. To complete this step, you must connect to the site using a web3 wallet. If you don't have a web3 wallet, follow our Wallet Setup Guide.

After signing in, click the `Create Index` button. This action prompts a transaction in your wallet, requesting you to submit the necessary gas for your platform's creation within the registry of Platform creators. This data is stored directly on the blockchain.

### Save Your Index

Upon successful completion, the process will continue and prompt you to copy the generated platform index, as shown below. You will need this index to complete the configuration process in Vercel.

### Deploy

Continue the final steps to this process as outlined in the [Deploy Configuration](/docs/vercel_config/) page.

## Customizing your DAO site

<Steps>
###  Connect Wallet
After deploying your new site, click on the `+` located in the top-right corner. This will prompt a dropdown menu to appear, which will allow you to Connect your wallet.

### Theme Editor

After connecting your wallet, you will see a button labeled "Edit Theme."

This modal enables you to update your DAO website by utilizing data from an [onchain registry](/docs/theming/onchain_theming). You can reference a theming configuration for any address or contract owned by another address.

#### Presets 
There are 5 themes available from the registry: `Default`, `Light`, `Midori`, `Nouns`, `Obscura`, and `Slime`.

#### Advanced 

For more advanced customizations, you can create new themes and update the DAO site without needing any coding skills. You have the option to change colors of the text and background, modify buttons, borders, and border size, select fonts, and overall form unique branding for your DAO site. After editing the theme, you can to revert it back to default, or save changes.

**Saving changes to your theme**

> To access this, admin privileges are required. In case you haven't assigned any admins for your site, you can follow the new `platformIndex` setup guide.
 
If you wish to save your design, you will be updating the theme in the themeRegistry. As an admin this happens through a signed transaction that builds a new reference for the metadata your site relies on.  Upon signing a brand new tokenURI is initialized as a `newTheme` with the signer serving as the `themeAdmin`. Admins can assign additional managers for the site who are also able to make updates to the site's overall layout.
