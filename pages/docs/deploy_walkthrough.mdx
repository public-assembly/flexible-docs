### Creating a New Project on Vercel

> For this step you will need to sign a GitHub account. If you donâ€™t have a GitHub account, follow our [Getting Started with GitHub](https://www.loom.com/share/b39dcc47d5724dbb937270191fc016a9) tutorial. This page is intended to exist as a reference guide as you go through the deploy process.

<Steps>
### Create Git Repository

Create a name for your new project. Make your repository public by unchecking the checkbox.

### Configure Project

Provide the required environment variables. Beside each input description is an example, but you must provide your own unique values.

<OptionTable options={[
  ['NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_INDEX', 'Platform index created via a Flexible template, i.e. `3`'],
  ['NEXT_PUBLIC_TOKEN_ADDRESS', 'Ethereum address of your DAO\'s NFT, i.e. `0xd2e7684cf3e2511cc3b4538bb2885dc206583076`'],

]}/>

### Deploy

With your environment variables configured, you're now all set to deploy your project to Vercel.

When your project finishes building, youâ€™ll be redirected to a success screen and prompted to continue to your Vercel dashboard. Here you will be able to view you website by clicking on the autogenerated link.

That's everything! If you have any trouble with this process, please [open an issue](https://github.com/public-assembly/flexible/issues/new) on GitHub.
