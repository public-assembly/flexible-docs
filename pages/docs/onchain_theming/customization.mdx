# Customizing Your DAO Site

<Steps>
###  Connect Wallet
After deploying your new site, click on the `+` icon located in the top-right corner. This will prompt a dropdown menu to appear, which will allow you to connect your wallet.

### Theme Editor

After connecting your wallet, you will see the `Edit Theme` button.

A drawer will appear that enables you to adjust a variety of theming parameters across the interface.

You can choose to alter the text and background colors, adjust the buttons, dropshadow, pick different fonts, and create a distinctive appearance for your site. To revert your changes, refresh the page.

Saving changes requires writing to the theme registry. Note that this action requires gas. Conducting this transaction establishes a new JSON reference for your site. Additionally, admins can assign managers who are also able to make updates to the site's theme. [Learn how to manage roles](/docs/advanced/manage_roles/).
