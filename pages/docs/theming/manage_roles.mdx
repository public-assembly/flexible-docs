# Managing Access Roles

Under the hood of [Flexible](https://flexible.vercel.app), a role-based access control mechanism determines who can edit theming data for a given platform. By default, the person who creates a `platformIndex` for a specific platform is given admin privileges. Moreover, methods are provided for easy management of multiple administrators/managers of a deployment. You can view the code for the theme registry contract [here](https://github.com/public-assembly/onchain/blob/master/theme-registry/src/PlatformThemeRegistry.sol).

## How to Grant Roles

### Quickstart

<Steps>

### Visit Etherscan

Head to [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9a23AE640040e4d34E9e00E500003000017144F4#writeContract#F1) and connect your wallet.

### Prepare the `grantRoles` function

Once connected, supply the appropriate function arguments.

1. `platformIndex` The index number created via using a Flexible template If you haven't minted it yet, check out our [Getting Started](/docs/getting_started/) page.

2. `roleDetails` The Ethereum address which you want to grant a role, followed by the number corresponding to that role. Below is an example of how the tuple should be formatted.

```solidity
[["0x9798A181E731Ee9d3abffc5ae15c93cA3d95A8e3", "1"]]
```

> You can assign a role to multiple addresses in the same transaction by separating the Ethereum addresses with commas.


<OptionTable
  options={[
    ["0", "NO ROLE"],
    ["1", "MANAGER (able to make changes to a platform's theme)"],
    [
      "2",
      "ADMIN (able to make changes to a platforms's theme, and add and revoke roles)",
    ],
  ]}
/>

> If you experience any errors make sure your tuple is formatted correctly.

### Confirm the transaction

Click the "Write" button next to the function, this will prompt a confirmation window from your wallet.
Keep in mind that you'll have to pay gas fees for the transaction, so make sure you have enough ether in your wallet to cover these costs.
After confirming the transaction, you can view its details on Etherscan by clicking on the transaction hash.
